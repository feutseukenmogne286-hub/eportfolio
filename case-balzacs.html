      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>This plan reinforced the value of aligning brand identity with market trends. I learned to set measurable objectives, balance creativity with feasibility and coordinate marketing activities across a year‑long timeline. Next time, I’d incorporate consumer surveys and taste tests to fine‑tune flavour development and pricing.</p>
